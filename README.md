# City Explorer Mini | Lab 6 - 9 | Code Fellows

**Author**: Tif Taylor
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
For Code Fellows 301 Week 2, we are working on creating individual back-end applications that can be plugged into a ready-made front-end application called City Explorer. This is an application designed to be able to input the name of a city and the application will send back an image of a map using the coordinates of that city as well as 4 informational boxes below the map image pertaining to information specifically from that city like Weather, Yelp results, Movies with the city name, and potential Hikes using APIs. 

## Getting Started
- Create your own GitHub Repo and build out the base files seen in this repo such as the .env, .gitignore, etc.
- Create the server
- Deploy the site somewhere, like Heroku
- Use that link on the main [City Explorer](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/) website to run your back end on their front end.
